# AsciiPoet

A simple Processing application for quickly creating and saving ASCII art.
This was created at the same time as [spaaace](https://github.com/vinhowe/spaaace), an Android live wallpaper outer space variant of [Asciiquarium](https://robobunny.com/projects/asciiquarium/html/) based on [cmatsouka/asciiqarium-applet](https://github.com/cmatsuoka/asciiquarium-applet). The name "AsciiPoet" was inspired by the completely unrelated [JavaPoet](https://github.com/square/javapoet) and [KotlinPoet](https://github.com/square/kotlinpoet) projects by Square.

[`AsciiPoet.java`](src/AsciiPoet.java) was last modified April 14, 2018.
